I also like to practice playing volleyball. Soon I'm going to try and get on a team when I get better at serving the ball straight. I love looking at fashion and outfits! In fact that was what my first article that i wrote about was fashion. I always love being inspired by anything. Like when I look at outfits online and try making them myself, or when I look at hair inspiration ideas on pinterest and try it out for myself. That's because I'm inspired by it and I try things out for myself because it doesn't really matter to me if I like it or not, because I'm just gonna say at least I tried it out for myself. Try something new if you haven't before to get inspired by something.
