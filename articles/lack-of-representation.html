        With fashion constantly changing, who is really responsible for the trends?

    <p>Fashion is a way you can truly express yourself. There's many different styles in fashion, but is there a right way to do fashion? Nobody should be able to answer that question because everyone has their own different opinion on it. Look at it this way, sometimes celebrities wear just anything basic or (extra) and it quickly becomes a new trend. Let's take Rihanna for example: One time she had gone to a basketball game with a simple cap and a cut tank top.  After that people started wearing more things like that out just because she had worn that outfit. My point is that fashion is a way to show off your unique style. It's like creating your own personal brand through the clothes, shoes, and accessories.. There's no right or wrong way to rock fashion because it's all about individuality and embracing your own creativity</p>

    <p>Some people like to follow the latest trends and wear what's popular, while others prefer to mix and match different pieces to create their own unique look. The key is to wear what makes you feel confident and comfortable. So whether you're into bold colors, funky patterns, or a more simple and classic style…-, remember that fashion is all about embracing who you are and having fun. People have been doing this for years. Perhaps the only thing different is the amount of attention it brings. Fashion is constantly changing and before you know it boom there's a new style that people like to discuss or wear.</p>

    <p>Fashion can be hard to figure out sometimes as there's always going to be at least a bit of a struggle behind it. That's sadly just the process of fashion and curating your own style. The real struggle is “How do I pull all of this together and make it work?” The first step is confident and the rest falls into place!</p>
